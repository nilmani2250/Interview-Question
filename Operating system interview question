Can you provide an example of multithreading?
Ans. Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.
Multithreading is used to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.

Threads share the same memory space, allowing for efficient communication and data sharing.

Example: A web server handling multiple client requests concurrently using separate threads.
