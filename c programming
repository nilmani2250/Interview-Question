1.what is Recursion?
->In one function definition if the same function gets called such function called as Recursion Function.

2.What is pointer?
->pointer s one of the derived secondary data type.
It is use to store address  of another variable.
which we can process data indirectly.

3.what is compilation stages?
-> compilation stages are four type.
  preprocessor-> preprocessor include the header files.
  -> remove of comments
  -> Replacement of macros
  ->  conditional compilation

  Translator-> Translator  is responssible for checking the synthical Error and it convert the c program into assembly level language.
  Assembler-> It will convert assembly ode into opcodes.
  
  Linker-> Linker is respossible for checking the searching the function definition.


4. What  is the Error?
 -> Error are two type 
  1. compile time:- Coompile time error is genereated by the compiler.
    
    compile time Error are three types
    -> preprcessor
    -> Translator
    -> Linker 
  2. Run time :- Run time Error is generated by the oprating system.
   
    Run time Error are three type
    -> Segmentation fault
    -> Floating point Exception
    
    
    
 What is static functions in c ?
 WWhat is malloc 
    -> Bus Error


 5. What is the volatile?
  -> volatile is keyword by using to keyword informing to the compiler not  to optimize our code .
     volatile is one of the type Qualifier.


 6. What  is data types?
  -> Data type are two type
   primary-: int, char, float
   secondary:
   sencondary are  two type data types
   Derived:- Array
             pointer
   
  User Derived :- Structure
                  union
                  Enum
                  Typedef


 7. what is null pointer?
  -> If pointer is Holding 0 as a address such pointer is called Null pointer.


 8. What is Null pointer?
 -> If pointer is Holding 0 as a address such pointer is called Null pointer.

9.  what is Array?
 -> Array is one of deriverd sencondary data type which is collection of similer type of data.which are in contigeous memory location.

10. What is call By value?
 -> while calling the function if we pass the value is known as call by value.

11. What is call by Refrence?
 -> While calling the function if we pass the address of variable is called as call by refrence.

12. What is storage classes?
 -> storage  classes are four types
  1. Auto :- auto is storage class, By default value is  garbage. By default every variable is auto only. auto is store is stack section.
  2. Static :- static is storage class, By default value is zero it is store in data section. static  life is multiple file.
              life will till end of the program.
 
 3. Extern :- Extern is storage class.defalut value is zero  it store is data section
             scope is with in block
             life is End of the program.
 4. Register :- Register is storage class default value is garbage it is store is cpu register.
                scope is with in block.
                Life is End of block.


13. what is DMA?
-> DMA also called is Run time memory allocation.
  two types of Memory allocation
 
 static:- Static are fixed memory allocation.
 Dynamic:- Dynamic are variable memory allcoation. 

14. what is malloc and calloc ?
 -> Malloc is used to allocate dynamic memory.
 -> Caloc is used to allocate dynamic memory.
 -> Malloc memory is not initialize.
 -> calloc  memory in set of Zero.
 -> Malloc is faster
 -> calloc is sefar.


15. What is the Relloc?
-> Relloc is used to allocate the memory and as well as to deallocate.

16. what is Structure?
-> Structure is one of the uer defined data type. wwhich is collection of diffrent types of data which is cntigeous memory allocation.


17. What is Bit field?
-> It is a mavhanism where we can allocate memory for a variable in the form of bits.

18. What is structure padding?
->  Allocating the extra for structure variable than the required one is called Structure padding.
    structure padding is compiler dependent process.

19. What is Memory leak?
-> In our total program how much allocate memory and how much diffrence is called memory leak.


20. What is Union ?
-> Union is user defined data type, which are store in same memory location.
  Union size depend upon is bigest data type.



21. what is typedef?
-> typedef is user defned data type, which are provied is new name or alize name to exiting data type.

22. What is Enum? 
-> Enum is one of the user defined data type which is used to provied a name to a integer constant.

23. What is Macro ?
-> Macro is small part of code. it is going to repalce of another part of the code.

24. What is Little Endian ?
-> It little Endian  Enrollment LSB stored in given Lower address.

25. What is Big Endian ?
-> In with Endian Enrollment LSB store in given Higher Address.
26. what is void pointer ?
-> void pointer is also known as generic pointer.
   A void pointer is a pointer that has no associated data type with it.
   A void pointer can hold address of any type and can be typcasted to any type.
