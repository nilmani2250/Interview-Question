1. Diffrence between  Microprocessor and Microcontroller ?
-> Microprocessor is general purpose CPU.
-> Microcontroller is combinatiom of cpu, memory and device controller embedded int single  chip.
-> Microprocessor is called is chip on a computer.
-> Microcontroller is called system on a chip.
-> Microprocessor power consumption is High.
-> Microcontroller power consumption is Less.
-> Microprocessor  memory size can be changed.
-> Microcontroller memory size can not be changed.
-> Microprocessor faster campared to the microcontroller.
-> Microcontroller slower campared to the Microprocessor.

2. Features of Microcontroller ?
-> 8051 is original designer was Intel.
-> 8051 is 8 bits CISC and Harvard architecher based microcontroller.
-> 8051 is available in 40 pins.
-> size of ROM is 4 kb.
-> size of RAM is 128 bytes.
-> 8051 has 4 number of IO ports(p0,p1,p2,p3).Each ports consists of a 8 IO pins.
-> 8051 has two 16 bits Timer and counter.
-> 8051 has full duplex UART.
-> 8051 has 6 numbers of interrupts.
-> Size of address bus is 16 bits and data bus is 8 bits.
