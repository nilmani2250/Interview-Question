1. UART
-> the uart is a parallel in serial-out and serial in parallel out device.
-> It is part of hardware.

2. Features of UART protocol.
-> Uart was designed by an gordon bell.
-> Uart is two wired comminication protocol
   -> TXD(transmitted data)
   -> RXD(recive data)
-> Uart is designed for peer to peer communication
-> Uart is full duplex communication protocol.
-> Uart is desinged asyncronous and syncronous serial communication.
-> long distance communication is possible by using UART.
-> Maximum speed of UART is 1 mbps
-> data transfer direction for LSB to MSB
-> parity checking is error detection method used in a UART protocol.
-> Size of standard data frame of the UART is 10 bits.

3. Baudarte
-> No of bits transmitted or recieved per second.
list of the baudarte :- 110 bps,4800bps,7200bps,9600bps.

4. Synchronous serial communication
->in synchronous communication microcontroller is master device used is slave.
-> max.speed of master should be eqqual or less than slave not more than slave then no synchronization will happen.
-> Master speed is decided by programmer we have to control.

5. Asynchronous serial communication
-> A common clock line is not used between transmitter and reciever.
-> Speed/baudrate is a major parameter used for synchronization.
-> In case of asynchronous speed of transmitter and reciver should be same.

6. SFR is used to communication with UART
  -> setting 
  -> Sending
  -> Recieving 
  -> monitor status
 
7. List of 8051 UART SFRs
  -> SBUF
  -> SCON
  -> TMOD
  -> TCON
  -> TH1

8. SBUF(serial buffer)
 -> It is transmitter and reciver buffer of 8051 UART
 -> size is 1 byte
 -> while transmitting SBUF acts as transmitter buffer and whil recievinf it acts as RX-buffer

9. SCON 
-> reset value of this register is 0x0
   -: SM0
   -: SM1
   -: SM2
   -: REN (Recive Enable)
   -: TB8
   -: RB8
   -: TI (Transmitted interrupt flag)
   -: RI (reciever interrupt flag)

10. what is Interrupts ?
-> An interrupt is a signal given to the CPU that causes the CPU to tompororily work on a diffrent takes and then later return
  to previous task.

11. Interrupts Handling 
-> we use cobination of both to write embedded program.
 
12. Interrupts metthod
-> In the interrup metthod whenever any device needs CPU service the device notifier the CPU by sending it an interrupt signal.
  
13. polling Method
-> polling method is contionously monitoring IO pins and register flag.

14. List of 8051 Interrupts
  1.Reset(non-maskable)
  2.External interrupt
  3.Timer 0 interrupt
  4.External interrupt
  5. Timer interrupt
  6. Uart interrupt
