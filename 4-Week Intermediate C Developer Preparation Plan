This structured plan will help you strengthen your intermediate C programming skills with a focus on pointers, memory management, data structures, and problem-solving.

Week 1: Pointers & Memory Management
Day 1-2: Pointer Basics
Revise pointer arithmetic (ptr + n, ptr - ptr, *ptr++, etc.)

Solve:

Swap two numbers using pointers

Implement strlen() and strcpy() using pointers

Find the sum of array elements using pointers

Day 3-4: Dynamic Memory Allocation
Practice malloc, calloc, realloc, and free

Solve:

Dynamically allocate a 2D array

Resize an array using realloc

Detect memory leaks using Valgrind (if on Linux)

Day 5-6: Advanced Pointer Concepts
Double pointers and pointer-to-pointer

Function pointers (callback mechanisms)

Solve:

Implement a function that takes a function pointer

Reverse a string using pointers

Find the largest element in an array using pointers

Day 7: Self-Assessment
Solve:

Merge two sorted arrays into a third array (dynamic)

Implement a dynamic stack (LIFO) using malloc/free

Week 2: Data Structures (Linked Lists & Strings)
Day 1-2: Singly Linked Lists
Implement:

Insertion (beginning, end, middle)

Deletion (by value, by position)

Reverse (iterative & recursive)

Detect a loop (Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm)

Day 3-4: Doubly Linked Lists & Circular Lists
Implement:

Insert/delete in a doubly linked list

Convert singly linked list to circular

Josephus problem (circular list application)

Day 5-6: String Manipulation
Solve:

Implement strstr() (substring search)

Remove duplicates from a string

Check if two strings are anagrams

Longest palindromic substring (medium)

Day 7: Self-Assessment
Solve:

Clone a linked list with random pointers (hard)

Implement atoi() with edge cases (negative numbers, overflow)

Week 3: Trees & Recursion
Day 1-2: Binary Trees
Implement:

Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals (recursive & iterative)

Find height of a binary tree

Check if a tree is balanced

Day 3-4: Binary Search Trees (BST)
Implement:

Insertion & Deletion in BST

Search for a key

Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA)

Validate BST (check if a tree is BST)

Day 5-6: Recursion & Backtracking
Solve:

Fibonacci series (recursive & memoization)

Tower of Hanoi

Generate all permutations of a string

N-Queens problem (if time permits)

Day 7: Self-Assessment
Solve:

Find the diameter of a binary tree

Print all root-to-leaf paths in a tree

Week 4: Advanced Problems & System Programming
Day 1-2: Bit Manipulation
Solve:

Count set bits in a number (Brian Kernighan’s method)

Check if a number is a power of 2

Swap two numbers without a temporary variable

Find the only non-repeating element in an array (XOR method)

Day 3-4: File I/O & Multithreading Basics
Practice:

Read/write structures to a file

Implement a simple text file copy program

(If on Linux) Basic threading with pthread (sum of array using threads)

Day 5-6: Algorithmic Problems
Solve:

Implement QuickSort or MergeSort

Find the maximum subarray sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)

Implement a hash table (chaining method)

Day 7: Mock Interview
Solve 2-3 problems under time constraints (e.g., Leetcode Medium):

Reverse words in a string ("hello world" → "world hello")

Detect cycle in a linked list (return the starting node)

Find the kth smallest element in a BST

Final Tips
Daily Practice: Spend at least 1-2 hours/day coding.

Debugging: Use gdb (Linux) or IDE debuggers to trace issues.

Memory Management: Always check malloc return values and free memory.

Optimization: After solving, think about time/space complexity improvements.
